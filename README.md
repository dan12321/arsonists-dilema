# arsonists-dilemma
 A game based on Conway's game of life.
[This game](https://dsongi.itch.io/arsonists-dilemma) was made as part of GMTK's "Out of Control" game jam. Unfortunately I didn't have much time that weekend to work on it so this is pretty rough around the edges.
Given the theme I made a game where you play an arsonist setting fire to houses and seeing the fire spread "Out of Control". The catch is you only have so many matches, specific buildings to aim for and the fire spreads in accordance with Conway's game of life. The puzzle is then to figure out where to set fires so it spreads to the targets.

##
Possible improvements I might make at some point
 - The UI is ugly. This could do with choosing a nice colour scheme and finish making the buttons
 - Add animations
 - Add sound
 - Add levels both exploring existing rules and with new building types
