# arsonists-dilemma
 A game based on Conway's game of life.
[This game](https://dsongi.itch.io/arsonists-dilemma) was made as part of GMTK's "Out of Control" game jam. Unfortunately I didn't have much time that weekend to work on it so this is pretty rough around the edges.
Given the theme, I made a game where you play an arsonist setting fire to houses and seeing the fire spread "Out of Control". The catches are you only have so many matches, there are specific buildings you need to aim for and the fire spreads in accordance with Conway's game of life. The puzzle is then to figure out where to set fires so it spreads to the targets.

Possible improvements I might make at some point
 - The UI is ugly. This could do with choosing a nice colour scheme and finishing the buttons (some are just the default)
 - Use introductory levels with only a few possible interactions to help the user discover the basic mechanics
 - Use methods such as higlighting on hover to make it more clear what can be interacted with
 - Add animations
 - Add sound
 - Add levels both exploring existing rules and with new building types
